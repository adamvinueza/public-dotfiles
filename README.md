My public dotfiles

So far, only my `.vimrc` and `.zshrc` files are here.

There are install (`install.sh`) and uninstall (`uninstall.sh`) scripts you can
use to put these into your home directory, or remove them. At the moment
installation and uninstallation is primitive--it doesn't check to see if the
backups are different.
